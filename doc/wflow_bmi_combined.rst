The wflow_bmi interface
=======================


Introduction
------------
In order to simplify conversion of an existing model to a reusable,
plug-and-play model component, CSDMS has developed a simple interface
called the Basic Model Interface or BMI that model developers are asked to implement.
Recall that in this context an interface is a named set of functions with prescribed
function names, argument types and return types. The BMI functions make the model
self-describing and fully controllable by a modeling framework.

The wflow_bmi_combined module implement a class that connect 2 or more bmi modules
and explorts those to the outside as a single bmi model.
